🚴 Rapido Ride Services – Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project on Rapido Ride Services, exploring ride patterns, customer behavior, and fare insights. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.



📊 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze ride service data to uncover insights that can help improve business operations and customer experience.

The analysis includes:

Demand trends by time, day, and location

Ride status and cancellation behavior

Fare structure and revenue breakdown

Insights into payment preferences

Actionable recommendations for service optimization



🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains approximately 50,000 ride records with 13 columns.

Features:

ride_id → Unique identifier for each ride

date → Date of the ride

time → Time of booking/ride

services → Type of ride service

ride_status → Completed / Cancelled / No-show

source → Pickup location

destination → Drop location

duration → Duration of ride

distance → Distance travelled

ride_charge → Base fare of the ride

misc_charge → Additional charges (if any)

total_fare → Final fare paid

payment_method → Mode of payment (Cash, UPI, Card, etc.)


Data Characteristics

8 categorical columns (e.g., payment_method, services, ride_status)

5 numerical columns (e.g., ride_charge, misc_charge, total_fare)

Missing values present in some fare-related columns

Outlier detection and imputation were performed


⚙️ Tech Stack

Python Libraries

pandas, numpy → Data cleaning & manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Interactive data analysis


📈 Key Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (ride_charge, misc_charge, total_fare)

Filled missing charges with mean values

Checked duplicates and removed inconsistencies

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Ride demand trends by date & time

Most frequent sources & destinations

Ride status breakdown (completed, cancelled, no-show)

Fare distribution and outlier detection

Payment method preferences

Business Insights:

Peak demand occurs during commute hours (morning & evening)

High last-minute cancellation rates

Majority of rides are short-distance trips

Optimizing driver allocation improves revenue
